    <h3>The City</h3>
<p>
    Over the past 3,000 years, the city of Beijing has had numerous other names. The name Beijing, which means "Northern Capital" was applied to the city in 1403 during the Ming dynasty to distinguish the city from Nanjing.
    <br>  <br> The English spelling Beijing is based on the government's official romanization (adopted in the 1980s) of the two characters as they are pronounced in Standard Mandarin. 
    <br>  <br>  An older English spelling, Peking, was used by Jesuit missionary Martino Martini in a popular atlas published in Amsterdam in 1655.
